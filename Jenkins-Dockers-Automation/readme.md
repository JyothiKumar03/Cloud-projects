This is a project based on Jenkins and Dockers
Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation tool that helps automate various stages of the software development lifecycle. It allows developers to define and execute pipelines, which consist of a series of steps to build, test, and deploy applications.

Prerequisites
Before running the Jenkins pipeline, make sure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
Jenkins (latest version)
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Launch the Jenkins web interface by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your preferred web browser.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Jenkins setup wizard.
Install any required plugins for your project by going to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" > "Available" tab.
Create a new Jenkins job by selecting "New Item" from the Jenkins dashboard.
Configure the job details, including the source code repository URL and Jenkinsfile location.
Save the job configuration and click "Build Now" to trigger the pipeline.
Monitor the pipeline's progress in the Jenkins dashboard, and view the console output for detailed logs.

Docker
Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment and management of applications using containers. Containers provide a lightweight and portable environment for running applications and their dependencies.

Prerequisites
Before running the Docker containers, make sure you have the following installed:

Docker (latest version)
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Build the Docker image by running the following command in the project's root directory:
Copy code
docker build -t myapp .
Run the Docker container using the following command:
arduino
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:80 myapp
This will start the container and map port 8080 of your host machine to port 80 of the container.
Open your preferred web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the application.
